### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**mvzyl/mvzyl** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my degree. To do so, I am getting to learn the ins and out's of Github. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I highly doubt that anyone needs to reach me at this point in time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love the outdoors, especially the ocean and recently learned that the meaning of my name is "Lady of the sea".
